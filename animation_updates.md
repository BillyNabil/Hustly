# Animation Refinement Summary

## Completed Updates
Based on your feedback to "make everything smoother" and "slow down animations", I have performed a comprehensive pass across the entire application.

### Global Adjustments
- **Slower Transitions**: Updated `animations.ts` to increase default durations for all global variants (`fadeUp`, `stagger`, `scaleIn`), ensuring a more relaxed, premium feel.
- **Micro-interactions**: Hover effects and button pulses are now gentler.

### Feature-Specific Refinements
I have updated the "Motion Graphic Visualizers" on **every** feature page to be significantly slower and more hypnotic rather than frantic.

| Feature Page | Animation Update |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Overview** | Momentum waves (4s), HUD scanning (15s), Orbit system (60s+) |
| **Finance** | Falling currency (5-10s), Chart drawing (4s) |
| **Vision** | Ambient orbs (15s), Floating particles (5-9s) |
| **Habits** | Pulse circles (6s), Ember particles (3-5s) |
| **Schedule** | Rotating rings (60s), Ticking hand (10s) |
| **Ideas** | Filament glow (4s), Floating sparks (6s+) |
| **Analytics** | Bar chart bounce (5s), Floating stats (8s+) |
| **Chat** | Neural lines (5s+), Rotating rings (30s) |
| **Goals** | Rising shapes (10s+), Target rings (8s) |
| **Achievements**| Starburst (60s), Falling stars (5s+) |
| **Challenges** | Slash effects (delay 8s), Swords rotation (4s) |
| **Leaderboard** | Podium rise (slow), Shine effect (4s), Empty state trophy (10s) |

### Components
- **Daily Challenges**: Confetti falls much slower (4s+) for a "floaty" celebration feel. Progress bar shimmer is more subtle.
- **Leaderboard**: Podium animations are more majestic and less "bouncy".

The application should now feel much more stable, professional, and "premium" without the dizzying speed of the previous animations.
